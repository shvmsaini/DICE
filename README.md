# DICEE

This app simulates two independent dice.

Random numbers are generated after clicking 'Roll Me' from 1 to 6 and then a image is displayed representing the number.

All the codes are based on java.

I am working on Andoird Studio 3.6.3 with Minimum SDK: API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop).

## Installation
